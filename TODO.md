## !FIXME!
- Path is fucked up with lots of duplicate entries

## shell-rc
- A prompt for RH-based distros
- Lighter-weight prompt

## Neovim
- Discard lazyvim and consider customized kickstart since I'm really not using much
- actually learn how to properly use the editor (soon&trade;)

## Packages
- Disable installation of anything ros-related by default
- bluetooth management
- RH-based installer (dnf)

## Other
- Add vimrc
