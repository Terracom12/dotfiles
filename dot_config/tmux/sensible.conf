# vim:set ft=tmux:

# Customization of https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-sensible with a few extra options
# Why would I use an entire plugin to set a couple of basic options?

# Time (ms) tmux waits after encountering ESC to check for a term
# escape sequence. Should be instant locally and if it takes
# more than 100ms over ssh, something is probably very wrong.
set -s escape-time 5  # ~5-100. https://superuser.com/a/1809494/224906

# Increase scrollback buffer size from 2000 to 50000 lines
set -g history-limit 50000

# Increase tmux messages display duration from 750ms to 3s
set -g display-time 3000

# # Refresh 'status-left' and 'status-right' more often, from every 15s to 5s
# set -g status-interval 5

# Upgrade $TERM
set -g default-terminal "screen-256color"

# Hope that this is never spelled "colour"
# Ensure terminal colors work correctly with tmux
set -as terminal-features '*256color:RGB:256'
# set -as terminal-features '*:hyperlink:clipboard:cstyle:mouse'

# Emacs key bindings in tmux command prompt (prefix + :) are better than
# vi keys, even for vim users
set -g status-keys emacs

# Focus events enabled for terminals that support them
set -g focus-events on

# Super useful when using "grouped sessions" and multi-monitor setup
setw -g aggressive-resize on

# More usable indicies (based on keyboard layout, 1-9 THEN 0)
set -g base-index 1

# Automatically renumber windows when one is closed
set -g renumber-windows on
